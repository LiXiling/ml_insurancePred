Insurance Claim Prediction using Machine Learning 
------------
This is my "Capstone Project" for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree (https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009)

It uses the data provided by a competition hosted on kaggle.com by Allstate (https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity).
