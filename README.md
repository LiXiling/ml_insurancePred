Insurance Claim Prediction using Machine Learning 
------------
This is my "Capstone Project" for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree (https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009)

It uses the data provided by a competition hosted on kaggle.com by Allstate (https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity).

## Contents:
* /docu/Capstone_proposal.pdf - the proposal file for this Capstone Project
* /docu/Capstone_report.pdf - the final report for this Capstone Project
* /insurance_prediction.ipynb - the developed code, as a IPython Notebook
* /docu/insurance_prediction.html - the IPython Notebook exported as HTML
* /data/train.csv - the dataset used in this project

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* scikit-learn 0.17
